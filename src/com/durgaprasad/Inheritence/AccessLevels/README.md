Trying to learn **Inheritence** feature in Java.  
A class can inherit features from another using "extends" keyword.
Inheritence helps to reuse code. Should be used only when **IS-A** test holds true.

eg:
* class Staff extends User
* class Editor extends Staff  

**public** members can be accessed by all subclasses.
**private** members cannot be accessed by all subclasses.
**default** members can be accessed by all subclasses present in a package.
**protected** members can be accesed by all subclasses present in and out of the package.
